AI Resume Analyzer with ATS Scoring
Introduction

The AI Resume Analyzer is an intelligent system that evaluates resumes and provides an ATS (Applicant Tracking System) score. It accepts resumes in PDF, JPG, and JPEG formats, analyzes the content, identifies skill gaps, and provides improvement suggestions along with relevant learning resources.

Objectives

Accept resumes in PDF and image formats

Extract and analyze resume content

Generate ATS compatibility score

Identify missing skills and keywords

Provide personalized suggestions and learning resources

Tools Used

This project was built using Canva AI for designing and presenting the interface and project materials. Chatbase was used as a no-code platform to build and deploy AI-based interactions. A structured PDF dataset was used to process and generate intelligent, context-aware responses.

Methodology

The system takes a resume as input and extracts its text using OCR and text-processing techniques. The extracted content is analyzed using AI and NLP methods and compared with relevant job-related keywords. Based on this analysis, the system generates an ATS score, identifies missing skills, and provides suggestions along with useful online resources.
